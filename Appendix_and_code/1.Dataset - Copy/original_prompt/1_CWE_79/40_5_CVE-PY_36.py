def getChild(self, path, request):
    """
    Retrieve a 'child' resource from me.

    Implement this to create dynamic resource generation -- resources which
    are always available may be registered with self.putChild().

    This will not be called if the class-level variable 'isLeaf' is set in
    your subclass; instead, the 'postpath' attribute of the request will be
    left as a list of the remaining path elements.

    For example, the URL /foo/bar/baz will normally be::

      | site.resource.getChild('foo').getChild('bar').getChild('baz').

    However, if the resource returned by 'bar' has isLeaf set to true, then
    the getChild call will never be made on it.

    Parameters and return value have the same meaning and requirements as
    those defined by L{IResource.getChildWithDefault}.
